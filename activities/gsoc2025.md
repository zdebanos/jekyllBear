Tl;dr for the GSoC evaluators - the proof of my work can be found here in these pull requests:

- [SHV Library](https://github.com/silicon-heaven/shv-libs4c/pull/11)
- [Integration of the SHV library into NuttX](https://github.com/apache/nuttx-apps/pull/3170)
- [Integration of the SHV library into pysimCoder, NXBoot updates](https://github.com/robertobucher/pysimCoder/pull/118)

As of 1st of September, I still need to address issues in the pull requests.

## Overview

The project I've participated in was called Firmware Upgrades over Silicon-Heaven Protocol for NXboot Demonstrated on pysimCoder.
Looking at the title, one may become lost in all the names used in the title.
Let's start slowly describing each part of my project!

### Silicon Heaven framework (SHV)

A framework with open-source protocol specification and implementation in many programming languages.
Developed and maintained by people from Elektroline, a.s., a Czech company.
The protocol specification can be found [here](https://silicon-heaven.github.io/shv-doc/index.html).

The protocol is used as a remote procedure call (RPC) system with custom serialization packing
schema (data serialization).
The fundamental structure in SHV is the communication tree comprised of nodes.
Each node has a set of methods, which are essentially just callbacks into my application.
In application, you can use the API to register your own functions as callbacks.

The SHV infrastructure requires a broker to handle all connected devices
(like in MQTT). This serves as a concentrator of all connected devices.

While Elektroline, a.s. has its own implementation in the C language,
my goal was to take the implementation already present in pysimCoder (more on that later),
developed by Michal Lenc, refine it, add file node implementation and
make a library out of it.
The advantage of my library lies in its simplicity - the whole communication
with the outer world just depends on two buffers - RX and TX, making
it feasible for memory constrained devices.

The only requirement to run this library is have an environment
where launching a communication thread is possible.

My new implementation is now located [here](https://github.com/silicon-heaven/shv-libs4c)
and supports POSIX out of the box, with tweaks to make it work
on Linux and NuttX.
Adaptation to any other RTOS (Zephyr, RTEMS, ThreadX) or Windows using Win32 API is possible.


### NuttX and NXBoot

Apache NuttX is a real-time operating system (RTOS) with an emphasis on standards compliance
and small footprint. Scalable from 8-bit to 64-bit microcontroller environments,
the primary governing standards in NuttX are POSIX and ANSI standards
(cited from [here](https://github.com/apache/nuttx)).

NXBoot is a bootloader developed by Michal Lenc as a replacement for MCUBoot.
NuttX features support for MCUBoot, however, Elektroline developers quickly
found out the scratchpad mechanism is a deadly killer for the external
flash ICs. When they tried to submit a simpler, yet flash-more-friendly method,
updating mechanism, they were met with backlash
[from MCUBoot maintainers](https://github.com/mcu-tools/mcuboot/pull/1902).

So they decided to implement this mechanism as a standalone bootloader into
NuttX.
